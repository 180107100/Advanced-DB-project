# Realty


This is a very difficult time in the world, because of the covid-19 pandemy. –êll areas of our lives need to change, namely digitalization. Our project just helps with this. How do you usually choose an apartment? You first go to the site with the ads, see the photos, and then go to see the apartment live. But often photos are not enough to assess the real scale of the house/apartment or its condition. To do this, we offer you a platform where home owners will upload videos of apartments to the site instead of photos. On the most popular sites like "krisha.kz", "olx.kz " this function is missing, which encourages you to either switch to another apartment, or go live, and it is often undesirable to do this in the current conditions.

To implement the project, we will create a website where everyone can find a suitable apartment, or sell their own. A prerequisite for submitting an ad is a good video quality. For the beginning of the project we got in touch with the realtors from Astana, Almaty and Kyzylorda. They provided us with videos of apartments that are in the status of sale, as well as information about the apartments. 

For the backend, we will use php, because it is an easy backend language to write, and we already have experience with it. For the database, we will use SQLite, because during the CSS348 course, it will be the main tool.
We named our project Realty, and hope it will be helpful and interesting.
